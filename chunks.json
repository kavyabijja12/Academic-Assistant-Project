Summer enrollment is required only if the student (1) begins the program in a summer term, (2) is completing a culminating experience (e.g., applied project), or (3) plans to graduate during the summer term. This credit must appear on the Plan of Study or must be an appropriate graduate-level course (e.g. 595, Continuing Registration)."

First term requests are sent to the student’s committee chair to approve and verify that the student is making adequate progress. If a second term request is necessary, along with the override request the student must submit a timeline of remaining requirements to verify how they plan to complete the program in that semester.\nCourses with grades of “W” (Withdrawal), “X” (Audit), or “I” (Incomplete) will not satisfy the continuous enrollment requirements for that semester. Students resolving an “I” grade must remain enrolled until the incomplete is cleared. Failure to meet continuous enrollment requirements may result in being withdrawn as an active student from the program.\nApplying for Graduation\nGraduate students should become familiar with the process of applying for graduation to ensure the graduation application is submitted by the deadline of the graduating semester. To view current and upcoming deadlines, students should log into MyASU and click on the Graduation tab. Before submitting the graduation application, students must ensure their Interactive Plan of Study (iPOS) is accurate, fully approved, and up to date.\nStudents completing an applied project must follow all Graduate College graduation procedures and submission deadlines.\nPre-Admission or Transfer Credit"

See the ASU Graduate Policies and Procedures for more information.\nCourse Load and Credit Limits\nRegistration in nine (9) credits is considered a full-time load for graduate students at ASU, and graduate students in the Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering are restricted to a maximum of 12 credits per semester. Overrides to register for more than 12 credits require the approval of the student’s committee chair and Graduate Program Chair and will be granted only in exceptional cases.

What is an iPOS? Great question. Let’s break it down in a few different sections.\nWhy?\nThe iPOS is essentially a contract between you and the university outlining what courses you will take to meet degree requirements. These courses will include the core (required) courses as well as any focus area and/or elective courses. The iPOS should be as closely aligned with your actual intended semester of enrollment as possible.\nThis should not take hours to complete. There will be some prep work you need to do (ex: review your program requirements and identify focus area and/or elective courses of interest to you). If the iPOS is taking too long to complete and you’re having any issues, go ahead and schedule an appointment with your graduate advisor. We are here to help!\nWhere?\nThe iPOS is an online submission process and can be accessed through your MyASU > My Program > iPOS.\nHow?\nStudents can submit their iPOS on their own, or meet with one of the graduate advisors for assistance in submitting the iPOS. For step-by-step instructions and an interactive video, please see the TPS iPOS How-To Guide ."

For step-by-step instructions and an interactive video, please see the TPS iPOS How-To Guide .\nThis guide will provide you with instructions on adding your past, present, and future courses, culminating experience options, and faculty advisor information. If you have any questions on your culminating experience or faculty advisor, please contact [[email protected]] or schedule an advising appointment.\nMS degrees should have 30 credits listed. Doctoral programs should have 60 credits for the DIT, or 84 credits for PhD.  The iPOS should be as closely aligned with your actual intended semester of enrollment as possible.\nApproval Process\nOnce you submit your iPOS, the graduate advising office completes an initial review to ensure courses meet basic degree requirements. We then send it off to the faculty advisor(s) noted and ask for the approval from the listed faculty. In addition, the program chair approves the iPOS submissions.\nAdditional notes\nThe iPOS can always be updated at any time. If your selection on focus area or elective adjust in a future semester, or you want to change your culminating experience, you are able to submit a change request. This will require the approval of your faculty advisor by way of the course change request. Be sure to have this approved prior to the start of the term to ensure you are not taking any classes that don’t apply to your program requirements."

    "text": "Continuous Enrollment Policy\nOnce admitted to a graduate degree program, students must be registered for a minimum of one credit hour of graduate-level coursework (not audit) during each fall and spring semester of their graduate education. Summer registration is required for students taking examinations, completing culminating experiences, conducting a doctoral prospectus, defending theses or dissertations, or graduating from the degree program in that semester. This credit must appear on the Plan of Study or must be an appropriate graduate-level course (e.g. 595, Continuing Registration). Courses with grades of “W” and “X” are not considered valid registration for continuous enrollment purposes.\nStudents who have completed all necessary coursework but still need to complete their culminating experience can request an override for 595 Continuing Registration for 1 credit hour to maintain active status in their program. First term requests are sent to the student’s committee chair to approve and verify that the student is making adequate progress. If a second term request is necessary, along with the override request the student must submit a timeline of remaining requirements to verify how they plan to complete the program in that semester.\nLeave of Absence Policy"

The Graduate College allows for a leave of absence for a maximum of two semesters during a student’s entire program. A petition for a leave of absence may be submitted through a student’s interactive plan of study and must be approved by the Graduate College. This request must be submitted and approved before the start of the semester of the anticipated absence.\nAn approved leave of absence will enable students to re-enter their program without reapplying to the university and the graduate program. Students who do not enroll for a fall or spring semester and are not on an approved Leave of Absence are considered withdrawn from the university under the assumption that they have decided to discontinue their program. A student removed for this reason may reapply for admission to resume their degree program; the application will be considered along with all other new applications to the degree program.\nA student with a Graduate College-approved Leave of Absence is not required to pay tuition and/or fees, but in turn is not permitted to place any demands on university faculty or use any university resources.

Fulton Schools of Engineering are restricted to a maximum of 12 credits per semester, with the exception of the MS Information Technology program, which are restricted to 11 credits per semester. Overrides to register for more than 12 credits require the approval of the student’s committee chair and Graduate Program Chair and will be granted only in exceptional cases. Requests to register for more than 15 credits will not be supported.\nInternships\nPolytechnic School graduate students can request to take an internship as a 584-course option for academic credit if an approved and eligible internship is obtained. Internship is not a requirement for graduate programs within The Polytechnic School but can be added as a planned option to the graduate plan of study. International students can apply for curricular practical training (CPT) if eligible to do so. No more than 3 credits of internship coursework can be used. The 3 credits can be divided between a maximum of two semesters for two different internship opportunities.

Culminating experience options vary by program.\nPortfolio\nThe portfolio is a highlight of three major accomplishments from the master's program and may include projects, papers, and exams. Portfolio submission includes a resume, and reflection of graduate program accomplishments with the supporting assignments/ projects included and is reviewed by the program chair for consistency in grading. There are specific submission timeframes (Spring - March/ Summer - June/ Fall - October) noted in the program section for eligible programs.\nA cover page needs to be included describing what courses the projects were carried out in, and why they were selected for inclusion in the Portfolio by the student. The Committee Chair and/or the Graduate Program Chair will be solely responsible for judging the quality of the portfolio and determining if it is satisfactory to serve as the required culminating event for the degree.\nWritten Comprehensive Exam\nThe written comprehensive exam is coordinated by the Graduate Program Chair who leads the administration of the comprehensive exam to the students in their final semester. Support is available from advising if an on-campus comprehensive exam is required. The exam takes place in the last six weeks of the semester. Grading is pass/fail. If a student fails, the student may petition to take the comprehensive exam one more time in a future term.\nCapstone"

Within the course, students will follow the syllabus and requirements outlined by the instructor. Credit is earned when a grade of B or better is awarded.\nApplied Project\nThe applied project is carried out under the supervision of a faculty member, typically a member of the program’s graduate faculty. Students are not assigned a faculty advisor. Students must take the initiative to contact a faculty member working in their area of interest. Students desiring to conduct an applied project must first obtain the approval of a faculty member to work with them on the project. This is recommended to be done before the end of the second semester (by +1 year for accelerated students). Enrollment in the applied project is in the last semester of the graduate program. An exception to this is for MS Human Systems Engineering as six credits/two semesters of enrollment are required. Applied projects are not required to be connected with industry. Applied projects are not eligible for CPT.\nAt completion of the applied project, a written document is required. The document is less involved than a thesis, is not expected to be published, and is more generalizable in comparison to the thesis, providing flexibility in the final format. In all cases, the student must prepare and present the applied project to the faculty advisor and discuss the implementation and results of their project. This presentation will be open to all graduate students."

Work involves a new research area or extension of previous research, taking a new approach to a topic. The thesis topic can be initiated by either the student or the faculty advisor. Students must adhere to Graduate College (GC) policies, formatting requirements, and deadlines. The final document is published through ProQuest through the GC processes.\nStudents are not assigned a faculty advisor. Students must take the initiative to contact a faculty member working in their area of interest. This should be done as soon as possible, but no later than the second semester of study. For accelerated Bachelor’s/Master’s students, the faculty advisor should be identified by the end of the last semester of the bachelor’s degree completion.

Atkinson\nby Learning and Teaching Hub | Aug 26, 2021 | Assistant Teaching Professor , Information Technology\nBrian L. Atkinson Assistant Teaching Professor Information Technology\nblatkin2@asu.edu, 602-543-3172\n\nSutton Hall, 301a Mesa, AZ 85212\nDr. Brian Atkinson successfully manages a multi-faceted career that straddles several spheres of the higher education ecosystem.  Throughout his professional life, he has balanced the unique ability to clearly articulate the complexities of datacentric and technological environments and tools, while developing leadership acumen, and establishing himself as a mentor, teacher, and scholar.\nDr. Atkinson began his technical career as a systems analyst managing an extensive data library within a research center at the University of Arizona (UA).  He quickly rose through the ranks to become a director and assistant dean whose responsibilities included managing infrastructure, technology, and creative services at the largest college at the UA. His intense focus on the intersection of technology and leadership was demonstrated through promoting numerous campus level initiatives and providing strategic and operational oversight for collegiate, departmental, group, and individual technical accomplishments.  While many of these successes were accomplished by members of the department that he founded, a noteworthy portion leveraged his strong commitment to dialog, collaboration, and cooperation and his understanding of social, technical, administrative, and organizational networks that are necessary to achieve cross-campus support.\nDr. Atkinson’s multidisciplinary research in natural language processing (NLP) leverages information retrieval (IR) and learning theory, data architecture and modeling, and multi-modal analysis techniques to examine the roles and characteristics of higher education information executives.  These are the very types of executives that he had worked with on numerous projects and initiatives during his 20+ years at the University of Arizona.\nIn addition to having earned a doctorate studying large-scale text analysis and processing, Dr. Atkinson also earned a terminal master’s degree in Information Resources & Library Sciences and a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree.  Both degrees remain integral to his teaching and research. Visual cognition, learning theory, and information retrieval consistently provide vital foundations that support identification and communication of the patterns found in extraordinarily large data sets and multi-faceted theoretical data constructs.\nDr. Atkinson is a Navy veteran and was recalled to active duty for the First Gulf War where he served as part of a ship’s navigational team.  Recently he returned from sailing a 43-foot catamaran in the British Virgin Islands, he has set his sights on earning his captain’s credentials before the upcoming summer.\nDr. Atkinson divides his time between Arizona and Illinois where his wife is a senior leader in the banking industry.\nPhD (2018) University of Arizona\nMLS (2002) University of Arizona\nBFA (1992) University of Arizona\nAtkinson, B.

His intense focus on the intersection of technology and leadership was demonstrated through promoting numerous campus level initiatives and providing strategic and operational oversight for collegiate, departmental, group, and individual technical accomplishments.  While many of these successes were accomplished by members of the department that he founded, a noteworthy portion leveraged his strong commitment to dialog, collaboration, and cooperation and his understanding of social, technical, administrative, and organizational networks that are necessary to achieve cross-campus support."

Visual cognition, learning theory, and information retrieval consistently provide vital foundations that support identification and communication of the patterns found in extraordinarily large data sets and multi-faceted theoretical data constructs.\nDr. Atkinson is a Navy veteran and was recalled to active duty for the First Gulf War where he served as part of a ship’s navigational team.  Recently he returned from sailing a 43-foot catamaran in the British Virgin Islands, he has set his sights on earning his captain’s credentials before the upcoming summer.\nDr. Atkinson divides his time between Arizona and Illinois where his wife is a senior leader in the banking industry.\nPhD (2018) University of Arizona\nMLS (2002) University of Arizona\nBFA (1992) University of Arizona\nAtkinson, B.

It is intended as a unique, hands-on learning experience to provide students with a number of valuable skills that they can use upon graduation.\nInternship is available to both domestic and international students. However, international students must work with the International Students and Scholars Center (ISSC) and submit additional documentation to obtain work authorization for CPT. Furthermore, international students must include the Internship course AMT, EGR, ERM, GIT, HSE, IFT, TMC 584 (1-3 credit hours, prefix dependent upon your major/program) as an integral part of their program (approved iPOS). Please see the section regarding international student requirements for more information.\nAll application materials for internship must be completed two weeks prior to the registration deadline for the semester/session. See the academic calendar for specific dates on registration. Students are responsible for enrolling prior to the drop/add deadline.\nTPS Graduate Student Internship Policies\nPlease review the specific TPS policies below related to graduate student internship experience.

Note that each student is required to file an iPOS early in the program and no later than the halfway point of program completion. Students who are not able to fulfill the internship credit requirements in their iPOS are required to replace the course credit requirements with an eligible graduate-level course. The internship course cannot be added to an approved iPOS once all coursework has been completed.

Not including this information will delay the approval of your application.\n* The job/internship description\n* The work location address(es)\n* A detailed paragraph on how the internship is applicable to the student’s program. Students should provide genuine reflection. Limited responses such as “because it is required” will cause an application to be denied. It must clearly spell out the educational experience and what will be learned during that time that cannot be learned from campus courses.\n* A paragraph on how the student’s efforts will be evaluated to meet performance metrics. This may require a conversation with the Faculty Internship Sponsor ahead of time. Once all these components are ready, the student will access the appropriate “Internship Course Application Form” linked on The Polytechnic School Internship Website."
