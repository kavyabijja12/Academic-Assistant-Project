Instructors and committees are responsible for defining what constitutes appropriate use of generative AI within their specific course or culminating experience (e.g., applied project). Graduate students are expected to consult their instructors or committee to determine whether, and to what extent, AI tools may be used.\nIf generative AI is permitted, students must clearly disclose its use and provide proper attribution in all submitted documents or presentations. Failure to disclose or unauthorized use of generative AI may constitute an academic integrity violation and could result in disciplinary action.\n\nStudents are encouraged to refer to the ASU Artificial Intelligence webpage, the Office of the University Provost’s Generative AI webpage, and the ASU Library Guide on Generative AI for guidance. These resources offer best practices for citing AI tools, linking to AI-generated outputs, and understanding the ethical considerations related to AI use in academic and research contexts.\nUse and Sharing of Academic Materials\n\nAll instructional content students engage with at ASU, including lectures, course materials, videos, assessments, and other educational resources, is protected by copyright.

What is an iPOS? Great question. Let’s break it down in a few different sections.\nWhy?\nThe iPOS is essentially a contract between you and the university outlining what courses you will take to meet degree requirements. These courses will include the core (required) courses as well as any focus area and/or elective courses. The iPOS should be as closely aligned with your actual intended semester of enrollment as possible.\nThis should not take hours to complete. There will be some prep work you need to do (ex: review your program requirements and identify focus area and/or elective courses of interest to you). If the iPOS is taking too long to complete and you’re having any issues, go ahead and schedule an appointment with your graduate advisor. We are here to help!\nWhere?\nThe iPOS is an online submission process and can be accessed through your MyASU > My Program > iPOS.\nHow?\nStudents can submit their iPOS on their own, or meet with one of the graduate advisors for assistance in submitting the iPOS. For step-by-step instructions and an interactive video, please see the TPS iPOS How-To Guide ."

For step-by-step instructions and an interactive video, please see the TPS iPOS How-To Guide .\nThis guide will provide you with instructions on adding your past, present, and future courses, culminating experience options, and faculty advisor information. If you have any questions on your culminating experience or faculty advisor, please contact [[email protected]] or schedule an advising appointment.\nMS degrees should have 30 credits listed. Doctoral programs should have 60 credits for the DIT, or 84 credits for PhD.  The iPOS should be as closely aligned with your actual intended semester of enrollment as possible.\nApproval Process\nOnce you submit your iPOS, the graduate advising office completes an initial review to ensure courses meet basic degree requirements. We then send it off to the faculty advisor(s) noted and ask for the approval from the listed faculty. In addition, the program chair approves the iPOS submissions.\nAdditional notes\nThe iPOS can always be updated at any time. If your selection on focus area or elective adjust in a future semester, or you want to change your culminating experience, you are able to submit a change request. This will require the approval of your faculty advisor by way of the course change request. Be sure to have this approved prior to the start of the term to ensure you are not taking any classes that don’t apply to your program requirements."

Helm then received his bachelor's and master's degree in communications engineering and used the GI Bill to complete an MBA. Helm has a doctorate in applied computer science. Helm worked as submarine warfare specialty officer and he started his engineering and technology career working Navy programs at Naval Space Command in Dahlgren, Virginia. When he retired from the military, Helm moved on to Motorola in Chandler, Arizona where he worked for the Strategic Electronics Division as a Systems Engineer on Special Programs. While at Motorola, Helm was also a division system engineering manager, and he worked on the iridium program (a multi-billion dollar space-based cellular phone system) as design and integration lead engineer and then as chief engineer. Helm was also was the lead architect in the development of Secure Internet Communications for government agencies when Internet security was still in its infancy. Helm left Motorola to become the assistant general manager for wireless engineering for North America at NEC Corporation in Irving, Texas. He led a division that designed and developed cellular phones. Helm retired from industry in 2005 and started teaching at the university level. Dr. Helm has a research interest in cybersecurity networking and cybersecurity education in support of Industry need.

Atkinson\nby Learning and Teaching Hub | Aug 26, 2021 | Assistant Teaching Professor , Information Technology\nBrian L. Atkinson Assistant Teaching Professor Information Technology\nblatkin2@asu.edu, 602-543-3172\n\nSutton Hall, 301a Mesa, AZ 85212\nDr. Brian Atkinson successfully manages a multi-faceted career that straddles several spheres of the higher education ecosystem.  Throughout his professional life, he has balanced the unique ability to clearly articulate the complexities of datacentric and technological environments and tools, while developing leadership acumen, and establishing himself as a mentor, teacher, and scholar.\nDr. Atkinson began his technical career as a systems analyst managing an extensive data library within a research center at the University of Arizona (UA).  He quickly rose through the ranks to become a director and assistant dean whose responsibilities included managing infrastructure, technology, and creative services at the largest college at the UA. His intense focus on the intersection of technology and leadership was demonstrated through promoting numerous campus level initiatives and providing strategic and operational oversight for collegiate, departmental, group, and individual technical accomplishments.  While many of these successes were accomplished by members of the department that he founded, a noteworthy portion leveraged his strong commitment to dialog, collaboration, and cooperation and his understanding of social, technical, administrative, and organizational networks that are necessary to achieve cross-campus support.\nDr. Atkinson’s multidisciplinary research in natural language processing (NLP) leverages information retrieval (IR) and learning theory, data architecture and modeling, and multi-modal analysis techniques to examine the roles and characteristics of higher education information executives.  These are the very types of executives that he had worked with on numerous projects and initiatives during his 20+ years at the University of Arizona.\nIn addition to having earned a doctorate studying large-scale text analysis and processing, Dr. Atkinson also earned a terminal master’s degree in Information Resources & Library Sciences and a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree.  Both degrees remain integral to his teaching and research. Visual cognition, learning theory, and information retrieval consistently provide vital foundations that support identification and communication of the patterns found in extraordinarily large data sets and multi-faceted theoretical data constructs.\nDr. Atkinson is a Navy veteran and was recalled to active duty for the First Gulf War where he served as part of a ship’s navigational team.  Recently he returned from sailing a 43-foot catamaran in the British Virgin Islands, he has set his sights on earning his captain’s credentials before the upcoming summer.\nDr. Atkinson divides his time between Arizona and Illinois where his wife is a senior leader in the banking industry.\nPhD (2018) University of Arizona\nMLS (2002) University of Arizona\nBFA (1992) University of Arizona\nAtkinson, B.

His intense focus on the intersection of technology and leadership was demonstrated through promoting numerous campus level initiatives and providing strategic and operational oversight for collegiate, departmental, group, and individual technical accomplishments.  While many of these successes were accomplished by members of the department that he founded, a noteworthy portion leveraged his strong commitment to dialog, collaboration, and cooperation and his understanding of social, technical, administrative, and organizational networks that are necessary to achieve cross-campus support."

    "text": "Dr. Atkinson’s multidisciplinary research in natural language processing (NLP) leverages information retrieval (IR) and learning theory, data architecture and modeling, and multi-modal analysis techniques to examine the roles and characteristics of higher education information executives.  These are the very types of executives that he had worked with on numerous projects and initiatives during his 20+ years at the University of Arizona.\nIn addition to having earned a doctorate studying large-scale text analysis and processing, Dr. Atkinson also earned a terminal master’s degree in Information Resources & Library Sciences and a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree.  Both degrees remain integral to his teaching and research. Visual cognition, learning theory, and information retrieval consistently provide vital foundations that support identification and communication of the patterns found in extraordinarily large data sets and multi-faceted theoretical data constructs.\nDr. Atkinson is a Navy veteran and was recalled to active duty for the First Gulf War where he served as part of a ship’s navigational team.  Recently he returned from sailing a 43-foot catamaran in the British Virgin Islands, he has set his sights on earning his captain’s credentials before the upcoming summer.\nDr. Atkinson divides his time between Arizona and Illinois where his wife is a senior leader in the banking industry.\nPhD (2018) University of Arizona\nMLS (2002) University of Arizona\nBFA (1992) University of Arizona\nAtkinson, B.

It is intended as a unique, hands-on learning experience to provide students with a number of valuable skills that they can use upon graduation.\nInternship is available to both domestic and international students. However, international students must work with the International Students and Scholars Center (ISSC) and submit additional documentation to obtain work authorization for CPT. Furthermore, international students must include the Internship course AMT, EGR, ERM, GIT, HSE, IFT, TMC 584 (1-3 credit hours, prefix dependent upon your major/program) as an integral part of their program (approved iPOS). Please see the section regarding international student requirements for more information.\nAll application materials for internship must be completed two weeks prior to the registration deadline for the semester/session. See the academic calendar for specific dates on registration. Students are responsible for enrolling prior to the drop/add deadline.\nTPS Graduate Student Internship Policies\nPlease review the specific TPS policies below related to graduate student internship experience.

Beginning Spring 2025: Full-time internships are allowable if all GPA’s are at least 3.0 and the student does not have additional coursework requirements outside of XXX 584 in that semester.

Note that each student is required to file an iPOS early in the program and no later than the halfway point of program completion. Students who are not able to fulfill the internship credit requirements in their iPOS are required to replace the course credit requirements with an eligible graduate-level course. The internship course cannot be added to an approved iPOS once all coursework has been completed.

The Fulton Schools Career Center can assist students in their job search, utilizing Handshake and career fairs, assisting with resume updates, and interviewing skills. Students can review the Internship Policies listed in this document to determine if the internship in question will meet all necessary criteria to be approved for academic credit. Students can reach out to the Internship Faculty Sponsor of their degree program for clarification or to verify if a specific internship is likely permissible ahead of time.\nStudents can also reach out to their Academic Advisor for general guidance on internship requirements and applicability for their major.\nIndividuals involved in the approval process:\nThe Student: That's you!\nThe Internship Supervisor: This is the individual that will be directly overseeing the internship. If it is a position within a company/organization, this is the direct supervisor overseeing the work completed.\nThe Academic Advisor: Polygrad@asu.edu will be listed as the academic advisor for signature routing and review by our graduate coordinator."

    "text": "Step-by-step guide to internship course approval/enrollment:\nAs outlined below, this process has several steps. Internship course requests must be submitted at least two weeks prior to the first day of the requested semester, but it is highly recommended that students submit their internship course application several weeks in advance of the semester they are applying for to ensure they have time to complete all needed steps.\nStep 1: Student is hired for an Internship.\nStep 2: Prior to accessing the Internship Course Application Form via Adobe Sign the student should compile the following materials so they are ready for entry/upload:\n* The job/internship offer letter - This will be needed as a separate attached document. Offer letter must include both start and end dates, number of hours per week, location, and for remote positions it must clearly note that it is a remote role. Not including this information will delay the approval of your application.\n* The job/internship description\n* The work location address(es)\n* A detailed paragraph on how the internship is applicable to the student’s program. Students should provide genuine reflection. Limited responses such as “because it is required” will cause an application to be denied. It must clearly spell out the educational experience and what will be learned during that time that cannot be learned from campus courses.\n* A paragraph on how the student’s efforts will be evaluated to meet performance metrics. This may require a conversation with the Faculty Internship Sponsor ahead of time. Once all these components are ready, the student will access the appropriate “Internship Course Application Form” linked on The Polytechnic School Internship Website."
