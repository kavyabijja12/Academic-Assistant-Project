Course Notes: Exploring Engineering and Our Futures as Engineers through Science Fiction: In this seminar, we will explore science fiction stories (through novels, graphic novels, and video) and relate them to engineering and to your own development as future engineers. At the end of the class, we will each create our own graphic novels to tell our past story, our story arc, and our future narrative. Fees: None Instructor(s): Brian Atkinson Offered By: Ira A.

Focuses on exploiting representations and identifying appropriate tools, applications and processes to analyze text and speech data, translation, summation, extracting information, semantic mapping and indexing, automatic query resolution, and developing natural interfaces to databases. Natural language processing is an extremely multidisciplinary, therefore includes ideas central to linguistics, computer science, machine learning and statistics.
