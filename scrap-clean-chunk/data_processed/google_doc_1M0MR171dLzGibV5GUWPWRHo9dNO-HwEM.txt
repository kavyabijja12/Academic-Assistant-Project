The Polytechnic School Internship Overview
Internship, also commonly known as Curricular Practical Training (CPT), is an academic experience usually obtained at off-campus work settings, allowing the student to apply knowledge and skills gained in various classes. It is intended as a unique, hands-on learning experience to provide students with a number of valuable skills that they can use upon graduation. 
Internship is available to both domestic and international students. However, international students must work with the International Students and Scholars Center (ISSC) and submit additional documentation to obtain work authorization for CPT. Furthermore, international students must include the Internship course AMT, EGR, ERM, GIT, HSE, IFT, TMC 584 (1-3 credit hours, prefix dependent upon your major/program) as an integral part of their program (approved iPOS). Please see the section regarding international student requirements for more information. 
All application materials for internship must be completed two weeks prior to the registration deadline for the semester/session. See the academic calendar for specific dates on registration. Students are responsible for enrolling prior to the drop/add deadline. 
TPS Graduate Student Internship Policies 
Please review the specific TPS policies below related to graduate student internship experience. Please contact polygrad@asu.edu if you have questions. 

Eligibility:
* Summer semester internship eligibility: all students (domestic and international) can participate in an out of state or an in-state internship, full-time or part-time in the summer semester if ALL of their GPAs are at least 3.0. 
* Fall and Spring semester internship eligibility: part-time and local or remote internships (for campus-based students) are allowable if all GPA’s are at least 3.0. Beginning Spring 2025: Full-time internships are allowable if all GPA’s are at least 3.0 and the student does not have additional coursework requirements outside of XXX 584 in that semester. Out of state internships may be approved with submission of the Out of State disclaimer for CPT approval (international students). 
 * No exceptions will be made for full-time and/or out of state internships when additional coursework is required for degree completion. 
* Inclusion of the internship course towards the degree requirements should be done at the initial submission of the student’s iPOS during the first two semesters of study. Note that each student is required to file an iPOS early in the program and no later than the halfway point of program completion. Students who are not able to fulfill the internship credit requirements in their iPOS are required to replace the course credit requirements with an eligible graduate-level course. The internship course cannot be added to an approved iPOS once all coursework has been completed. Exceptions may be made if the internship is relevant to thesis research. 
* A student’s graduation date cannot be extended in order to accommodate an internship.
* The student must be in good standing at the time of the internship application (on track and not on academic probation). Graduate students must have an ASU post-baccalaureate cumulative GPA and graduate GPA of 3.0 or above at the start of the internship semester. 
* The internship must be an off-campus activity. The ASU Print & Imaging Lab is the only approved on-campus internship opportunity. The practicum (580), research (592), or applied project (593) opportunity is better suited for on-campus opportunities outside of regular coursework. 
* Internship cannot be used to substitute required coursework in any program. 
* Internship is intended as a unique new learning experience, apart from a current employment position. Therefore, it is not typically available to full or part-time workers regularly employed by the company where the internship is proposed. It may be possible to arrange an internship with a current employer if certain conditions are met. The student and employer must define a new project outside the scope of the current job requirements. This needs to be outlined in the Internship Course Application and submitted with the job description as to verify the internship responsibilities will be outside the scope of the current job. 
* It is unethical for students to continue to seek or consider other employment opportunities once an offer has been accepted. ASU, the Polytechnic School (TPS) expects students to honor an acceptance and withdraw from all employment seeking activities. Students who accept an offer from an organization and have an approved internship application on file with TPS advising will not be granted a different internship approval for the same academic semester should the student decide to decline their first offer to accept a different opportunity.
* Internship (584) is required for inclusion in the program requirements plan of study (iPOS) for graduate students. The student can work with their academic advisor to determine this in consultation with the Program Chair. Internship may be necessary if it is a mandatory requirement of a program, a student needs practical experience to complete qualifications for an advanced degree, needs industrial experience to gain the ability to perform required degree thesis research, or needs the use of unique industrial facilities not available on campus to complete a research study. Students must complete one semester at ASU before becoming eligible for an internship; international students must follow ISSC requirements related to CPT eligibility. 

Credit Allowance

* Each unit of internship must require a minimum of 45 clock hours of work. A three credit-hour internship would require a minimum of 135 clock hours of work. 
* Graduate students may be permitted to take a maximum of 3 credits of 584 towards their plan of study and may choose to split the credits for a maximum of three semesters, beginning in Spring 2025. No more than 3 credits of internship or three semesters is allowed and students should plan accordingly. If a student wants to take internship credit in addition to their degree requirements (in addition to the 30 credit hour requirement), only two credits and two semesters of internship is permitted.
* Accelerated BS to MS students may be eligible to take 584 internship credit as part of their degree requirements or in addition to their degree requirements. For Accelerated BS to MS students in the aviation, engineering, and information technology programs, 1-3 credits of internship is allowable in addition to the credit hour requirement (30 credit hours depending on enrolled graduate program). For 4+1 students in the graphic information technology, human systems engineering, management of technology, or user experience, 1-3 credits of internship is allowable as part of the elective requirements for the program. 

Start and End Dates: 
* Students cannot start their internship experience before the semester or session students enroll in the internship credit. For example, if you are interested in doing an internship in the summer semester, you cannot start working until the summer semester officially starts (1st day of classes). Internship start and end dates must meet the guidelines noted below: 
 * Fall Start: First day of the Fall semester / Fall End: Last day of the Fall semester final exams (graduating students) OR the day before the first date of the spring semester (continuing students)
 * Spring Start: First day of the Spring semester / Spring End: Last day of Spring semester final exams (graduating students) OR the day before the first date of the summer semester (continuing students). 
 * Summer Start: First day of the Summer semester / Summer End: Last day of the summer session (graduating students) OR the day before first date of the fall semester (continuing students)

 * Internship end dates can be the last day of finals week OR the day prior to the start of the following semester (unless it is the student’s final semester - contact your academic advisor) for the fall and spring terms. For summer, the end date must be the last day of the session of enrollment. After the drop period, credit hour adjustments to the internship course is not permitted for any reason. Refer to the academic calendar for semester start and end dates. 

International Students
 * To be eligible for CPT you must have maintained F-1 status for a minimum of one academic year and meet all eligibility requirements.
 * During the regular Fall and Spring semesters international graduate students in F-1 status must register for a minimum of nine (9) credit hours to maintain full-time status and be enrolled in a minimum six (6) credit hours of in-person, on-campus coursework at an ASU campus. A maximum of three (3) credit hours of iCourse (online course) is permitted. Students cannot request a Reduced Course Load to accommodate an internship, unless they are otherwise eligible for one. 
 * CPT is meant to be a practical training experience provided to the employee by an employer, participation in CPT under a 1099 independent contractor arrangement is not permitted. 
 * International students that have completed all of the degree requirements are not eligible for CPT or internship for academic credit. International students should apply for OPT instead of CPT. Please speak to your assigned academic advisor for more information.
 * International students planning to complete an internship must adhere to all items mentioned in this policy as well as the International Student Scholars Center (ISSC) CPT/OPT Policy. See also CPT instructions on this document. 

Grading 
 * The 584 internship is a pass/fail class. The grade will be determined by the faculty sponsor of the course, based on the evaluation of the internship supervisor and the quality of the technical report. 
 * A technical report of 2 double-spaced pages (minimum 500 words) describing in detail the learned concepts, techniques, and/or procedures is due by the last day of classes of the semester/session in which the internship is carried out. It is the student’s responsibility to ensure that both report and evaluation are sent to the faculty sponsor and the advising office (polygrad@asu.edu) by the due date. If there are concerns with confidentiality of the report within the company hosting the student, the student is responsible for having his/her supervisor contact the faculty sponsor as soon as possible. 
 * Internship Employer Evaluation Form submitted to faculty sponsor and Advising Services Office. 
How-to Guide and Internship Checklist 

Finding an internship:
It is up to the student to make the appropriate outreach or follow the necessary application procedures to attain a desired internship. The Fulton Schools Career Center can assist students in their job search, utilizing Handshake and career fairs, assisting with resume updates, and interviewing skills. Students can review the Internship Policies listed in this document to determine if the internship in question will meet all necessary criteria to be approved for academic credit. Students can reach out to the Internship Faculty Sponsor of their degree program for clarification or to verify if a specific internship is likely permissible ahead of time. 
Students can also reach out to their Academic Advisor for general guidance on internship requirements and applicability for their major. 
Individuals involved in the approval process: 
The Student: That's you! 
The Internship Supervisor: This is the individual that will be directly overseeing the internship. If it is a position within a company/organization, this is the direct supervisor overseeing the work completed.
The Academic Advisor: Polygrad@asu.edu will be listed as the academic advisor for signature routing and review by our graduate coordinator. 
The Internship Faculty Sponsor: A designated faculty member from the program that the internship is offered through. Students typically will work with the program chair, or you can select any faculty member in your program that you’d like to be responsible for grading your internship course. Thesis and applied project students typically request their faculty advisor to oversee this process. Students in the MS IT program must select Dr. Elbadrawy as their internship faculty sponsor. The expectation is that students have a conversation with their Internship Faculty Sponsor about the internship they are planning to pursue for academic credit before submitting the Internship Course Application Form. This is to ensure all initial questions have been addressed and that the internship likely meets the minimum guidelines for approval. 
The Program Chair: This is the program chair of your designated degree program. 
Who is your program chair: 

Graduate Program Chairs:
 * Artificial Intelligence Engineering (Human-Centered AI) (TMC 584 or HSE 584): Jason Bronowitz (jbronowi@asu.edu) 
 * Aviation (AMT 584): Greg Files (gfiles@asu.edu) 
 * Clean Energy Systems (EGR 584): Arunachala Mada Kannan (amadakan@asu.edu) 
 * Data Science, Engineering and Analytics (Human-Centered Applications) (HSE 584): Scotty Craig (sdcraig2@asu.edu) 
 * Engineering (EGR 584): Samantha Brunhaver (sbrunhav@asu.edu) 
 * Environmental and Resource Mgmt (ERM 584): Kiril Hristovski (khristo@asu.edu) 
 * Graphic Information Technology (GIT 584): Christina Carrasquilla (ccarra1@asu.edu)

 * User Experience (GIT or HSE 584): Scotty Craig (sdcraig2@asu.edu) 

Step-by-step guide to internship course approval/enrollment: 
As outlined below, this process has several steps. Internship course requests must be submitted at least two weeks prior to the first day of the requested semester, but it is highly recommended that students submit their internship course application several weeks in advance of the semester they are applying for to ensure they have time to complete all needed steps. 
Step 1: Student is hired for an Internship. 
Step 2: Prior to accessing the Internship Course Application Form via Adobe Sign the student should compile the following materials so they are ready for entry/upload: 
 * The job/internship offer letter - This will be needed as a separate attached document. Offer letter must include both start and end dates, number of hours per week, location, and for remote positions it must clearly note that it is a remote role. Not including this information will delay the approval of your application. 
 * The job/internship description 
 * The work location address(es) 
 * A detailed paragraph on how the internship is applicable to the student’s program. Students should provide genuine reflection. Limited responses such as “because it is required” will cause an application to be denied. It must clearly spell out the educational experience and what will be learned during that time that cannot be learned from campus courses.
 * A paragraph on how the student’s efforts will be evaluated to meet performance metrics. This may require a conversation with the Faculty Internship Sponsor ahead of time. Once all these components are ready, the student will access the appropriate “Internship Course Application Form” linked on The Polytechnic School Internship Website.

Students need to input their name and email address into the form, and then their Internship Supervisor’s name and email. The Academic Advisor and Internship Faculty Sponsor’s name and email may automatically be filled in. If not, add Polygrad@asu.edu for the Academic Advisor. Your faculty sponsor can be your faculty advisor or a faculty member in your program. 
Step 3: Once fully filled out, the submitted Internship Packet is emailed to the Internship Supervisor via AdobeSign. The Supervisor will fill out the requested information, sign, and submit. 
Step 4: The Internship Packet is then emailed to the Academic Advisor for review via AdobeSign. 
Step 5: Internship materials reviewed via Adobe Sign by the Academic Advisor. The Academic Advisor will review the packet for the necessary information before signing. NOTE: International students requesting to do an out of state internship will be required to also submit the Out of State Internship Disclaimer before advising will sign the internship application. The form can be sent to polygrad@asu.edu. See eligibility requirements for out of state internships noted under the Eligibility section of this document. 
*If not approved: students will be notified of any incomplete internship packet items by correspondence to their ASU email. The student will need to make appropriate updates, or provide updated documentation to support the internship. 
Step 6: Materials are approved by the Academic Advisor. The Internship Packet is emailed to the Internship Faculty Sponsor via Adobe Sign. 
Step 7: The Internship Packet is reviewed and signed by the Internship Faculty Sponsor via Adobe Sign. 
Step 8: The Internship Packet is reviewed and signed by the program chair via Adobe Sign. The completed packet is then sent to Advising for processing. 
Step 9: The Academic Advisor will provide the needed course permission override for the requested course and save a copy of the completed application to the student’s file. Please allow 1-2 business days for processing time after the document has been signed by all parties.
Step 10: The Academic Advisor will send an email to the student’s ASU email account letting them know when they are able to register for the requested course. 
Step 11: Students should follow any registration details included in the email from the Academic Advisor and add the course to their schedule as soon as possible. Students must successfully register for the approved internship course prior to the final registration deadline for that session/semester. Students should refer to the ASU Academic Calendar for enrollment deadlines.
Step 12: If the student is an International Student, they will need to request their CPT through the ISSC: https://issc.asu.edu/students/employment/f1-cpt. See below for more information. 
Final Step: In order to receive a grade, the following are required within 10 days of internship completion: 

 * A technical report of 2 double-spaced pages (minimum 500 words) describing in detail the learned concepts, techniques, and/or procedures is due by the last day of classes of the semester/session in which the internship is carried out. It is the student’s responsibility to ensure that both report and evaluation are sent to the faculty sponsor and the advising office (polygrad@asu.edu) by the due date. If there are concerns with confidentiality of the report within the company hosting the student, the student is responsible for having his/her supervisor contact the faculty sponsor as soon as possible. 
 * Internship Employer Evaluation Form submitted to faculty sponsor and Advising Services Office.
