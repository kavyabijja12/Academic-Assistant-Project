Programming and Database Security Number: 16536 Instructor: Dinesh Sthapit Location: ASU Online Dates: 1/12 - 5/1 (C) Units: 3 Seats: 36 of 60 Course Description: Covers the main concepts of middleware technologies. Includes the various methodologies used to integrate applications, databases and Web services. Students develop multilevel applications using programming/scripting languages (such as PHP, Java, Python, Perl) which access data stored in a database. Middleware programs typically control database access and protect database SQL programs from security breaches. Students access the data from applications and other Web technologies such as XML, as well as protecting the data from unauthorized access. Enrollment Requirements: Prerequisite(s) with C or better: ACO 320, CSE 412, IFT 300, or SER 322; IFT 301 OR GIT 417; IFT 383; Credit is allowed for only CSE 414 or IFT 458 or IFT 554 or IFT 598 (Middleware Programming and Database Security) OR Visiting University Student Consent: No consent required for this class.
