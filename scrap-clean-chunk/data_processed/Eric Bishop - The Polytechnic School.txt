Fulton Schools of Engineering Eric Bishop brings nearly 30 years of expertise in information technology, cybersecurity, and higher education, shaping the next generation of IT professionals at Arizona State University, a leading research institution. Bishop’s teaching portfolio includes courses in programming, Linux systems administration, and information security, delivered through both online and in-person formats. His commitment to curriculum innovation and student success has seen him contribute to department-wide reengineering efforts, incorporating the latest instructional technologies to improve learning outcomes. Bishop’s extensive academic career includes his tenure as department chair for the Computer Information Systems department and faculty member at Northland Pioneer College, as well as a full-time faculty role at Northern Arizona University, where he taught courses in Computer Information Technology. As a lecturer at Boston University, Bishop taught multiple graduate-level computer science courses, managing large class sizes and mentoring students and teaching assistants to ensure high-quality education. Beyond his academic roles, Bishop served as Chief Information Officer at Northland Pioneer College, where he provided strategic leadership for the college’s technology infrastructure and led several transformative IT initiatives while serving as a member of the president's executive team. His leadership and expertise were demonstrated through multiple federal technology grants, including partnerships with IBM, the U.S. Department of Labor, the Arizona Department of Commerce, and Mesa Community College to develop and deliver innovative curricula for software quality engineering. In addition to his academic and professional achievements, Bishop is a recognized expert in digital forensics, information security, IT governance, and IT management. His expertise is showcased through leadership roles, conference presentations, and a range of industry certifications, including but not limited to GIAC Certified Forensics Examiner (GCFE), GIAC Critical Controls Certification (GCCC), and COBIT and ITIL certifications for IT governance and IT management. His forensics skills were further recognized when he earned the prestigious “Lethal Forensicator” challenge coin for his performance in a forensics challenge at a SANS conference. Bishop has also presented at conferences such as EDUCAUSE, the Higher Learning Commission Annual Meeting, and other notable industry gatherings. Bishop also served as President of the Arizona Community College Technical Officers Council (ACCTO) from 2013-2014 and was a member from 2009-2014, contributing to statewide IT leadership and initiatives within Arizona’s community college system. Prior to his academic and professional career, he served in the United States Marine Corps, an experience that shaped his disciplined approach to leadership and problem-solving. As a former peer reviewer for the Higher Learning Commission, Bishop helped assess the quality of institutions across the U.S. The role of a peer reviewer is vital in ensuring that universities and colleges meet rigorous standards of quality in areas such as academic programming, governance, and student success. Peer reviewers help maintain the integrity of higher education by evaluating institutions’ compliance with accreditation criteria, ensuring academic standards and quality are upheld across institutions. Bishop’s dedication to public service is reflected in his presidential appointment to the United States Selective Service System as a Local Board member, a role essential to national defense readiness. He previously served on the Planning and Zoning Commission in Show Low, Arizona, where he was the chairman. Bishop earned his Master of Science in Computer Information Systems with a concentration in Information Security from Boston University. He is currently pursuing a PhD in human systems engineering at Arizona State University, further advancing his expertise in user-centered technology design. His passion for integrating cutting-edge research in areas like human-computer interaction, usability testing, and emerging technologies with hands-on experience continues to benefit his students and the broader IT community.
