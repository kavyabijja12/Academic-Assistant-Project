﻿Individualized Study Request Form | Process and Instructions 




Students needing an override for 590 Reading and Conference, 592 Research or 593 Applied Project may initiate the request via Adobe Sign. Complete all required fields, including your information, class information, scope of the class, deliverables, and due date. Once electronically signed, it will be routed directly to the faculty for review and signature, and then to TPS Graduate Advising for processing.


In order to process your request efficiently, please make sure all fields are completed and detailed information regarding your independent study is provided. Please contact polygrad@asu.edu if you have any questions. 


Eligibility:
* Enrollment into an independent study course requires approval from a faculty member to first support the class. These courses are jointly planned by the student and faculty to identify the scope and deliverables of the class. The specific scope of each independent study will vary, based upon the student’s interest and faculty member’s areas of expertise. 
   * 590 Reading and Conference is designed to meet specific learning needs of the student when the content is not addressed in an available course. 
   * 592 Research is designed as an option to support students who have a topic of interest that they wish to more fully investigate. 
   * 593 Applied Project acts as the culminating experience for students in eligible graduate programs. Not all graduate programs allow for the applied project option. 
* Most programs allow a maximum of 3 credits of research and 3 credits of reading and conference. Exceptions and program allowance may vary. 
* Registration into 593 Applied Project requires an approved iPOS, indicating the project as the culminating experience, and correct faculty advisor prior to approval of the form. 
* Faculty supporting the independent study should be within the student’s respective programs. Some exceptions may be allowed for 590 and 592 coursework.
