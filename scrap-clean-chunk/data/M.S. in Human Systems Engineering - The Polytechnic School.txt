The Master of Science (MS) degree in Human Systems Engineering (HSE) is a two-year program offered through the Human Systems Engineering program at Arizona State University Polytechnic School (part of the Fulton Schools of Engineering).
Areas of specific focus have included aviation, consumer products, educational technology, health care, military applications, cyber security, and public safety. Students in this program will have opportunities for practical experience in diverse laboratories as well as internships in a variety of settings.
HSE MS and PhD programs are accredited by the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society .
Why Human Systems Engineering?
The program is hands-on and challenging, and the field is growing quickly, creating opportunities for further study and employment. The areas of application include:
User Experience
Human systems Integration
Healthcare Human Factors
Learning design
Sports psychology
Aviation human factors
Human-Robot Interaction
Recent graduates are working at places like Intel, Boeing, GoDaddy.com and the Air Force Research Lab. Recipients of our master’s have also gone on to pursue a doctorate at ASU and other prestigious programs. The program offers specialized training to complement the B.S. in human systems engineering in the Polytechnic School.
Students currently enrolled in the BS in Human Systems Engineering degree program can select the Accelerated Master’s Degree option .
Choose from five concentration areas:
All students within the MS Human Systems Engineering program will complete the following degree requirements:
30 credit hours and a Thesis, or
