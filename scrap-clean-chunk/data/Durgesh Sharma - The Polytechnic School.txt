Dates: 1/12 - 5/1 (C)
Units: 3
Seats: 52 of 60
Course Description: Develops a workflow structure and implementation of an end-to-end Machine Learning (ML) environment, from a hands-on DevOps (Development - Operations) perspective. This workflow structure forms the substrate for the layers of algorithms and models that are intended to implement and deliver/monitor analytics and AI products. To that end, the student learns about modern data storage evolutions (e.g., LakeHouses/Delta Lake) and end-to-end management/governance of machine learning/AI models (MLFlow) and products. Also deepens knowledge of advanced data analysis and statistical techniques that arise in data analytic and monitoring applications as students see how the ML work integrates with their substrate development.

Course Description: Develops a workflow structure and implementation of an end-to-end Machine Learning (ML) environment, from a hands-on DevOps (Development - Operations) perspective. This workflow structure forms the substrate for the layers of algorithms and models that are intended to implement and deliver/monitor analytics and AI products. To that end, the student learns about modern data storage evolutions (e.g., LakeHouses/Delta Lake) and end-to-end management/governance of machine learning/AI models (MLFlow) and products. Also deepens knowledge of advanced data analysis and statistical techniques that arise in data analytic and monitoring applications as students see how the ML work integrates with their substrate development.
